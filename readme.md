## SimpleNDChat

### Version 1.0.0

## About:

- This resource was originally created by Andyyy, but was discontinued at some point in the past, where another person took on keeping it up with ND_Core, however, also seemed to discontinue the resource. This resource simply just gives you a chat script that works with ND_Core and grabs your character's name + job in the server.

# How to Install:

- This resource can be as simple as just a drag and drop, not much configuration options required. As of now within this version 1.0 nothing is job locked, however at some point in the future there will be some in later updates.

# Credits:

1. Andyyy - The Original Creator
2. N1K0 - 2nd person that updated NDChat
3. SimpleDevelopments - Current Publisher
